This is because both its spin and charge should oppose the electron’s. This would mean both would bend in the same direction! We’re interested in seeing the difference in the spins so we flip the machine to make this clearer. \n\n**We show curved spacetime using Flamm’s Parabaloid, which we discovered is controversial, more notes on that here - https://ve42.co/HBDFlamm",
